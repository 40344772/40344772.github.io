      <p>Welcome to The Academy. In the Academy we are going to tell you the essentials to be a
        captain of one of our ships. We recently developed a new line of ships that are gonna
        go into the undiscovered sectors of our galaxy to find new planets, life forms and any
        other strange phenomenons that occur.
      </p>

      <p>So lets get you through the basic training so you can be qualified to be in command
        of your ships.
      </p>

      <p>Here is what you need to know, Space Explorers must follow a set of rules we call the
        Sworn Promise. These rules are essential so planets in the galaxy can follow there
        natural evolution and develop at its on pace.
      </p>

      <p> The sworn Promise rules are:
        <br>Rule 1: You can not interfere in the development of a planet including the development of the alien life/society.
        <br>Rule 2: You must try and communicate with a unidentified ship before attacking.
        <br>Rule 3: You must not allow non space explorers on the ship.
        <br>Rule 4: If your ship is being taking over you must abandon ship if the threat cannot be contained.
        <br>Rule 5:
      </p>

      <p>You can review these rules at anytime by clicking the conatact command button at the top
        of the page. You can also save and load your playthroiugh by clicking the save and load buttons
        and you can return to this page at anytime by clicking the menu button
      </p>

      <p> You may encounter words that you as an earthling might not understand
        but thanks to our great scientist out our headquarters in San Fransico.
        We should be able to transalte certain words while your on your mission.
        If a word is highlight click on it to get a more informed meaning.
      </p>

      <p> I feel we have almost completed your training. One last thing before you head off.
        We at space explorers take violations very seriously. So please take the Sworn Promise
        very seriously. Depending on how badly you break these rules you and your whole crew could face charges of treason.
        Or worse you could be killed in action
      </p>

      <p> You have completed your training and i can now appoint you captain of the SE-NCC-1701 also know as the Starship
          Millennium
